# Aims: To analyze rice genomic samples for potential and undesired PthXo3 and AvrXa7
# TAL effector nucleases (TALEN) off-target sites that were originally targeted at
# OsjSWEET11 (Os8N3) and OsjSWEET14 (Os11N3) promoter regions, respectively.
# Aim1: To check for the presence and location of the T-DNA sequences in the transgenic plant genomes.
### Aim2: To validate the presence of TALEN mutagenesis at the targeted OsjSWEET11 (Os8N3) and OsjSWEET14 (Os11N3) promoter regions.
### Aim3: To search for the presence and locations of TALEN mutagenesis at off-target site.

## Sample description:
# YB1: Oryze sative Japonica cv. Kitake, mock treatment (control)
# YB2-YB8: transgenic Kitake plants with independent treatment for the TALEN-targeted mutagenesis
# at the OsSWEET11 and OsSWEET14 promoter regions.

## TALEN
# OsjSWEET11 and OsjSWEET14 are both on the reverse strand.
# The TATA box: TATAAA is marked with ^
# The PthXo1 EBE: 5'GCATCTCCCCCTACTGTACACCAC (5'GTGGTGTACAGTAGGGGGAGATGC) is marked with 1 [3,4].
# The PthXo3 EBE: 5'ATATAAACCCCCTCCAACCAGGTGCTAAG (5'CTTAGCACCTGGTTGGAGGGGGTTTATAT) is marked with 3 [3,4].
# The avrXa7 EBE: 5'ATAAACCCCCTCCAACCAGGTGCTAA (5'TTAGCACCTGGTTGGAGGGGGTTTAT) is marked with 7 [3,4].
# The PthXo3 and avrXa7 overlap on their OsjSWEET14 EBE
# The TALEN-RVD1 is marked with x, and the TALEN-RVD2 is marked with o.
