*bin/* directory contains ancillary codes and scripts:
- *xgetseq*: retrieves reference sequences and prepares BLAST databases
- *getTarget.py*: retrieve sequence fragment by sequence range
- DFPstat.sh: evaluate the phylogenic relationship of samples using Deletion Fingerprints (DFP) numbers shown in \*_SeqDel_sum_\*.table
- DFPtree.py: evaluate the phylogenic relationship of samples by hierarchical clustering of sample cultivar based on their distances measured by the proportion of shared DFPs.
