## Aims: To analyze rice genomic samples for potential and undesired [PthXo1 and AvrXa7] TAL effector nucleases (TALEN) off-target sites that were originally targeted at OsjSWEET11 (Os8N3) and OsjSWEET14 (Os11N3) promoter region, respectively, for mutagenesis.
## Aim1: check for the presence and location of the T-DNA sequences in the transgenic genomes. 
## Aim2: validation for the presence of TALEN mutagenesis at the targeted OsjSWEET11 (Os8N3) and OsjSWEET14 (Os11N3) promoter regions.
## Aim3: check for the presence and location of TALEN mutagenesis at any off-target site.
 
## Sample description:
# YB1: Oryze sative Japonica cv. Kitake, mock treatment (control)
# YB2-YB8: transgenic Kitake plants with independent treatment for the TALEN-targeted mutagenesis at OsSWEET11 and OsSWEET14 promoter region.

##-------------------------
## Proposed Methods:
#1.Reads procession and denovo assembly
Process the Illumina reads from BY lab for quality trimming and adaptor removal using TRegGA workflow step 1.
Denovo assembly of processed Illumina reads using TRegGA workflow step 2.

#2.Confirmation for the absence of T-DNA sequence
Ti plasmid was used to deliver the TALEN genes into rice and integrate into genome for targeted promoter mutagenesis. The T-DNA that integrated into plant genome were removed using genetic crossing method after the target promoter mutagenesis was confirmed.
To confirm the absence of T-DNA sequence, we will blast search the scaffolds for the T-DNA sequence.
  
#3.Confirmation for the TALEN mutagenesis 
The TALEN was designed to target at specific sequence at the OsjSWEET11 (Os8N3) and OsjSWEET14 (Os11N3) promoter region for mutagenesis. To confirm the mutagenesis, the target sequences will be used as references for reference-guided assembly using the TRegGA workflow step 3.

#4.TALEN off-target site investigation: focused approach
Even if the TALEN is designed to target at particular sequence, the TALEN could potentially also bind to unintended locations due to the nature of ambiguous binding in TAL effectors, and resulted in undesired side effects for the mutagenesis.
To check for any presence of the TALEN off-target sites, we propose to look for the presence of mutagenesis on the predicted off-target sites using softwares such as TALE-NT2 [1] or TALENoffer [2]. The predicted sites can be used as the references for the rfguided  assembly, which in turn will be investigated for the occurence of mutagenesis.

#5.TALEN off-target site investigation: whole-genome approach
Since the TALEN off-target sites could potentially occure at locations not predicted by computational methods, a comprehensive investigation can be done on the whole genome assembly of sample genomes.
The PacBio reads from BY lab will be used to improve the scaffolding of the Illumina reads for the whole genome assembly, followed with searches for the occurence of mutagenesis patterns in the genome assembly.

## Target: OsjSWEET11 (Os8N3) with the TRegGA assembly
# Gene: SWEET11 OS08G0535200
# Description: Bidirectional sugar transporter SWEET11 [Source:UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot;Acc:Q6YZF3]
# Synonyms: Os8N3, XA13
# Oryza sativa Japonica Location: Chromosome 8: 26,725,952-26,728,794 reverse strand.
# About this gene: This gene has 1 transcript (splice variant), 26 orthologues and 18 paralogues.
# About this transcript: This transcript has 5 exons.
# Take chr8:26,725,001-26,730,000 (5 Kb) as the target for TRegGA, which should include promoter region for the TALEN modification target site.

# Note: OsjSWEET11 is on the reverse strand. The OsjSWEET11 TATA box is marked with ^, and the PthXo1 effector-binding element (EBE) at OsjSWEET11 is marked with * [3,4]. 

# Discussion: the result indicates the YB8 PthXo1 EBE at OsjSWEET11 has a 11-bp deletion mutation caused by TALEN, which would inactivate binding of PthXo1 onto the OsjSWEET11 gene.
