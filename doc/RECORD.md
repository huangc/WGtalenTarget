### Description of YB samples
* YB1 is a wildtype and the progenitor (grand parent) of YB2 to YB8 (grand kids), the parent of YB2 to YB8 was not sampled and sequenced.
* The offspring of YB1 contains 5 bp deletion in SWEET14 and produced many seeds (embryos), from which a numnber of embryos were used for inoculation with TALEN_SWEET11. As a result, 7 embryos survived and became YB2 to YB8 at the same time during the second round of mutagenesis, then were sampled for sequencing.

### Q&A
* Q: If YB2 and YB3 share a common transposition event, that is likely to have occurred in the progenitor cell that eventually produced YB2 and YB3.
*  R: YB2 and YB3 or YB2 to YB8 all should share certain changes (including -5 bp deletion and a common transposition event) that occurred during the first mutagenesis cycle from YB1. However, the transposition, if any, and TALEN action on SWEET11 in the second round of mutagenesis should be independent.

If there is a common event between YB4 and YB5, that occurred in the
progenitor of those two.
R: Yes, most likely.

If an event is shared between YB2, YB3, YB4, and YB5, then we assume
that this event happened even earlier, before the generation of the YB23
and YB45 progenitors.
R: should be like from John.

-How many cell divisions are there between the YB1 mother cell and the seed stage?  I thought a single plant produces hundreds of seeds.
R: Here is how the tissue culture and transformation works:
A single plant produces hundreds of seeds, each seed has one embryo that is put on hormone (auxin) medium to induce callus cells (stem cell, undeferentiated cells) for about two weeks, then the whole cluster of cells is incubated with Agro strain, lot of cells will be infected but in most cases only one cell will integrate the T-DNA in its genome and the T-DNA gives the advantage to the single transformed cell over other untransformed cells in the medium containing hormone to induce cell division and importantly the antibiotics (e.g., hygromycin) to kill those untransformed cells; the transformed cell will survive and divide and form a new cluster of cells which are transformed to a new medium containing another cocktail of hormones to induce shoot and eventually plantlets, of which one plant is selected. That is an example of one seed (embryo), we use a lot of seeds (embryos) each time to do transformation with one construct, resulting in many independent transformation events (or independent transgenic plants) including YB2, ... or YB8.
