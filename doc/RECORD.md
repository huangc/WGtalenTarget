### Description of YB samples
* YB1 is a wildtype and the progenitor (grand parent) of YB2 to YB8 (grand kids), the parent of YB2 to YB8 was not sampled and sequenced.
* The offspring of YB1 contains 5 bp deletion in SWEET14 and produced many seeds (embryos), from which a numnber of embryos were used for inoculation with TALEN_SWEET11. As a result, 7 embryos survived and became YB2 to YB8 at the same time during the second round of mutagenesis, then were sampled for sequencing.
