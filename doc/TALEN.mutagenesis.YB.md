### TALEN Mutagenesis for YB samples
1.  BY1 is the wild type Kitaake which was used for introduction of TALEN construct targeting the promoter of SWEET14 (or Os11N3, a SWEET in chromosome 11) through tissue culture and transformation to get a stable mutant line. This line was one of many lines we got in the first round of mutagenesis with TALEN technology, and this line contained one 5-bp deletion in the promoter of SWEET14 and had the TALEN transgene segregated out (transgene free) as determined by PCR approach. 

2.  Then this line was used for the second round of mutagenesis with another TALEN construct targeting the promoter of SWEET11 (or Os8N3, a SWEET in chromosome 8) again through tissue culture and transformation. As a result, seven independent lines of many transgenic lines that contained distinct base pair changes in the intended target site (promoter of SWEET11) were identified as TALEN transgene free again with PCR approach. 

3.  The nucleotide sequence changes are the same 5-bp deletion in SWEET14 in BY2 to BY8, in SWEET11: -50 bp in BY2, -5 bp in BY3, -21 bp in BY4, -8 bp in BY5, -12 bp in BY6, -700 bp in BY7 and -11 bp in BY8.  We expect those changes to be detected in the whole genome resequencing data since we particularly PCR amplified the relevant regions and sequenced them (you are doing blind test).

4.  We may also expect that the two TALEN constructs might cause off-target mutations and that two rounds of tissue culture and transformation might also cause mutations (e.g., transposons, TOS17 as one, might be activated under the stress of tissue culture - high hormone condition). That is why we need to know through the whole genome resequencing, assembly or annotation and comparative analysis between wild type Kitaake and BY2 to BY8.

5. The two TALEN constructs were delivered by Agrobacterium into plant cells, and we only determined the TALEN gene free based on the PCR results by using several sets of gene specific primers. It is possible there is residual fragment(s) still left over in the genomes of mutants. We can blast the whole resequencing data with the TALEN transgene sequence to determine this. The Chinese group once found that using the TALEN sequences as query with 19 bp as a cut off, no hit was found in BY2 to BY5 and BY8, only got hits in BY6 and BY7. 

6. Therefore, the objectives of the project are
    1. determine the genomic variations caused by TALEN technology (off-target by TALENs and mutations by tissue culture and transformation);
    2. determine if the mutagenized lines are transgene free.
