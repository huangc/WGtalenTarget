## Association of pTALEN and deletion sites
# In the result of Blat analysis (psl file), the pairwise sequence alignments are described as connected blocks.
# The gap between blocks is used here to infer the gap derived from pTALEN binding and deletion.
# A pTALEN binding site and a deletion site is called associated if the pTALEN site is within PDEL bp from the deletion site,
# where PDEL is the distance in bp from the near edge of pTALEN to the near edge of deletion site.
# Smaller PDEL value infer stronger association of pTALEN binding and deletion, and better candidate for pTALEN target.
# Cases for how pTALEN (marked ==) are associated with the deletion. 
# Sequence is marked -----, blanks are deletions, while the associated deletion is xxxxx.
# RefSeq  |---------|       |-----------------|xxxxxxxxxxxx|----------------------------| 
# Case1                         |==|<--PDEL-->|           
# Case2                                                    |<---------PDEL------->|==|
# Case3                                            |==|
# Case3. PDEL is not considered for target selection when the pTALEN is situated inside the deletion.
# In turns of better pTALEN targets, Case3 > Case1 > Case2.
