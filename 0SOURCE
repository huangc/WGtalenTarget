## PTALEN is a list of paired TALEN RVD sequences to be subject to the Target finder analysis.
# The RVD sequences are defined in PREREQ.sh file
PTALEN="pTALEN_Os11N3 pTALEN_Os8N3"

## Association of pTALEN and deletion sites
# In the result of Blat analysis (psl file), the pairwise sequence alignments are described as connected blocks.
# The gap between blocks are used here to infer the gap derived from pTALEN binding.
# A pTALEN binding site and a deletion site is called associated if the pTALEN site is within 
# ${PTALEN_INDEL} bp from the deletion site.

# |----------------------------------blk1-----------------------------|   |--------blk2--------|   |-----blk3----|
# Good candidate                                           |--rvdseq1--| |--rvdseq2--|
# Bad candidate    |--rvdseq1--| |--rvdseq2--|
#                                             |<---------PDEL-------->|

## PDEL is parameter to define the association between pTALEN site and deletion site.
# Good candidate gap for pTALEN associated deletion would have small PDEL value.
# PDEL: the distance (bp) from the near edge of pTALEN to the near edge of deletion site.
PDEL=10
# DELNUM is the estimated number of deletions that may be covered within the length of pTALEN
# pTALEN is 70-80 bp in average, including the spacer. Deletions are at least GAP_MINSIZE.
# Thus you can have at most 80/GAP_MINSIZE deletions been covered by pTALEN. Set DELNUM accordingly.
# For each pTALEN record, SAMPLENUM * DELNUM is the number of lines to be grepped for comparing with the pTALEN records.
DELNUM=5

GAP_BORDER=400
