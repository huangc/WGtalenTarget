## *data/* directory: contains final results and reports
* SeqDel_\*.table: is the deletion summary table for all samples, generated by x2-WGindelT. 
* SeqDel_sum_\*.table: is also the deletion summary table for all samples, but with the deletions sites of the same gap start site and gap size been aggregrated by sample, and generated by x2-WGindelT.
* pairedtalesf.pTALENs-on-\*.txt: is the paired TALEN binding sites, generarted by x3-WGtalen.
* SeqDel_pTALENs-on-\*.OUT: is the join table that contains the "associated" pTALEN and indels for all samples, a.k.a. the potential pTALEN target sites, generated by x3-WGtalen.
* blat_at_pTALENdel/: is the subdirectory that contains the blat alignments of the pTALEN target sites against the reference reported in SeqDel_pTALENs-on-\*.OUT, generated by x3-WGtalen. Files of \*.psl.pretty is the concised version of the \*.psl.pretty.long where a long deletion region is indicated by its length instead of its actual sequences. 
* blastn.TDNA-on-\*.table: is the blast result of the leftover TDNA vector sequence against sample contigs, generated by x4-WGtdna.
* REPORT.md: (optional) additional description and interpretation of the results.
