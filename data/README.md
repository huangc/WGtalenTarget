* REPORT-pTALEN.md: additional description and interpretation of the pTALEN results. 
* SeqDel_sum_\*.table: is the deletion summary table for all samples. Deletions sites with the same gap start site and gap size are aggregrated by sample. This table is generated by x2-WGindelT.
* pairedtalesf.pTALENs-on-\*.txt: is the paired TALEN binding sites, generarted by x3-WGtalen.
* SeqDel_pTALENs-on-\*.OUT: is the join table that contains the "associated" pTALEN and indels for all samples, a.k.a. the potential pTALEN target sites, generated by x3-WGtalen.
* blat_at_pTALENdel/: The deletion site from reference sequence plus its surrounding GAP_BORDER size, as reported in SeqDel_pTALENs-on-*.OUT, is retrieved for blat alignment against sample contig for evaluation of the pTALEN target site.
* blastn.TDNA-on-\*.table: is the blast result of the leftover TDNA vector sequence against sample contigs, generated by x4-WGtdna.
